When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  -when the work cannot be modified in only one computerm it means that you have more 
  than one work stations.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  -As you are working on experimental changes or unsignificant changes, or even some
  bugs on what's new you don't want them to be online.
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?
	Forks are similar to clones, you basicly clone a project with both, but
	when you fork a project, you make a copy onto your GitHub account, when
	you clone you do from anything in GitHub onto your computer. And when you
	create a branch you make a version of your projecto to modify something,
	it means you don't work on the master branch in order to maintain it as
	the principal one.

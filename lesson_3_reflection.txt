When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  -when the work cannot be modified in only one computerm it means that you have more 
  than one work stations.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  -As you are working on experimental changes or unsignificant changes, or even some
  bugs on what's new you don't want them to be online.
